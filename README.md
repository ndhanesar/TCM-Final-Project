# TCM-Final-Project
Final Project for Think Code Make - Nishta Dhanesar and Sydney Zirlin

We have created a clock that displays a gif that corresponds to the current time. We have also included wake up, lunch time, and nap time options that will allow the user to select specific times for these activities, ultimately changing the gif that appears when selected. There is a party button that will trigger a party gif as well.
